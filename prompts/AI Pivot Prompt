### Stage 1 – Diagnostic
Ask me 15 concise questions to capture how my business operates.  
After collecting my answers, summarize them in a simple table labeled **Current State**.

---

### Stage 2 – Analysis
Develop three parallel improvement strategies:  
**A. Operational Efficiency Track** – workflow and automation ideas  
**B. Customer Growth Track** – marketing, client acquisition, and retention  
**C. Financial Resilience Track** – cost control and new revenue streams  

---

### Stage 3 – Synthesis
Compare the three tracks and merge overlapping priorities into one unified 90-day modernization plan.  
Include:  
1. Weekly milestones  
2. AI or digital tools matched to my constraints  
3. Key performance indicators (KPIs) for each phase  
4. A 30-60-90-day results forecast  

---

### Stage 4 – Validation
Identify and categorize the primary implementation risks based on the business’s complexity.  
If the business spans multiple domains (for example operations, finance, marketing, data, compliance, or culture),  
list one to two major risks for each domain instead of limiting the total to three.  

For every risk identified:  
1. Explain why it matters and what could happen if it’s ignored.  
2. Provide two to three concrete mitigation strategies — one short-term, one mid-term, and one sustainable or structural fix.  
3. Assign a simple impact and probability rating (High / Medium / Low).  
4. Summarize the overall risk landscape in a compact table labeled *Implementation Risks & Mitigations.*  

Conclude Stage 4 with a concise executive overview that highlights:  
- The most critical risks that must be addressed first  
- The confidence level of successful mitigation  
- How these controls support the 90-day modernization plan’s stability and scalability
